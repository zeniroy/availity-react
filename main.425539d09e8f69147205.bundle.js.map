Note: This is where OpenShift comes into play. OpenShift will ensure the right file (based on the ENV) is placed in the right location when the pod starts.\\n\\n##### generate-features-json Arguments\\n\\n- **`path-to-features.json`**: Directory path or file location. Optional, default: `project/config/features.json`. If a directory path, a `features.json` file must exist in the directory. If a file location, it must be a `.json` file. Note: Follow the example `features.json` file for what the contents of the file should be.\\n- **`path-to-build-dist`**: Directory path: Optional, default: if `NODE_ENV` is \\\"production\\\" `dist/features`, else `build/features`. The location in which the various environment specific JSON files will be output. Note: OpenShift is looking for the `features` directory in the web root of the image, so if this value is changed, ensure that the resulting image has the `features` directory.\\n\\n##### generate-features-json Usage\\n\\n```bash\\ngenerate-features-json\\ngenerate-features-json ./features.json\\ngenerate-features-json other-path dist/features\\n```\\n\\n###### As npm script\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"av build && generate-features-json\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nwith extra parameters\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"build\\\": \\\"av build && generate-features-json ./features.json\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### features.json\\n\\nThe `features.json` file is a single file which details \\\"features\\\" and the environments in which each feature is **disabled** in. Typically the name of the feature is the JIRA ticket number which the feature was developed for. This helps identify what the feature does by just knowing the name.\\nPossible `disabledEnvironments` values are `\\\"DEV\\\"`, `\\\"STAGE\\\"`, and `\\\"PRD\\\"`. These values line up with the `ENV` environment variable within OpenShift.\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"PREC-4597\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"https://jira.availity.com:8443/browse/PREC-4597\\\",\\n    \\\"disabledEnvironments\\\": [\\\"PRD\\\"]\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"CB-675\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"https://jira.availity.com:8443/browse/PREC-4597\\\",\\n    \\\"disabledEnvironments\\\": [\\\"STAGE\\\",\\\"PRD\\\"]\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThe environment specific features.json files which gets generated will be a simple array of disabled feature names. The above example would produce a `PRD.json` with `[\\\"PREC-4597\\\", \\\"CB-675\\\"]` and `STAGE.json` with `[\\\"CB-675\\\"]`.\\n\\nEnabling and disabling features does require a deployment, but with the OpenShift CI/CD process, that _should_ be painless.\"","export default \"# @availity/feedback\\n\\n> Availity feedback with simley faces react component.\\n\\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@availity/feedback.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@availity/feedback)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @availity/feedback --save\\n```\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport Feedback from '@availity/feedback';\\n// ... \\n<Feedback>\\n  {/* ... */}\\n</Feedback>\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n#### Feedback (Default export)\\nA component which does awesome things!\\n\\n##### Props\\n\\n- **`appName`**: String.

'Hello' : 'World'}</div>;\\n};\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n#### useToggle\\n\\nSimple hook that returns a boolean that can easily be toggled. Useful for loaders, and simple toggle components.\\n\\n##### Arguments\\n\\n- **`initialState`**: Boolean. Optional. The intital state of the toggle. Default: `false`.\\n\\n##### useToggle Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { useToggle } from '@availity/hooks';\\n// ...\\nconst Component = () => {\\n    const [isToggled,toggle] = useToggle();\\n\\n    return <div onClick={toggle}>{isToggled ? 'Hello' : 'World'}</div>;\\n}\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\nYou can also pass the state you are looking to set the toggle to and if its already set it will not perform a state update.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// This component will never re-render because the toggle is already set to `true`\\nconst Component = () => {\\n    const [isToggled,toggle] = useToggle(true);\\n\\n    return <div onClick={() => toggle(true)}>{isToggled ? 'Hello' : 'World'}</div>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### useEffectAsync\\n\\nHook that will allow asynchronous functions to be called in the standard `useEffect` React hook.\\n\\n##### Arguments\\n\\n- **`effect`**: The effect to be called just like the function given to `useEffect`.\\n- **`inputs`**: The watch params for the effect just like the second arg in `useEffect`.\\n\\n##### useEffectAsync Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\nimport { useEffectAsync } from '@availity/hooks';\\n// ...\\nconst Component = ({ asyncFunction }) => {\\n  const [state, setState] = useState('Hello');\\n  useEffectAsync(async () => {\\n    const newState = await asyncFunction();\\n\\n    setState(newState);\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  return <div>{state}</div>;\\n};\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n#### useTimeout\\n\\nHook that will return `true` after the given amount of time in milliseconds.\\n\\n##### Arguments\\n\\n- **`milliseconds`**: The number of milliseconds to wait before returning true.\\n\\n##### useTimeout Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\nimport { useTimeout } from '@availity/hooks';\\n// ...\\nconst Component = () => {\\n  const timeIsUp = useTimeout(5000);\\n\\n  return <div>{timeIsUp ? 'Time is up' : 'Still waiting'}</div>;\\n};\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n#### useMount\\n\\nHook that will run a function on mount and dismount if a function is returned.\\n\\n##### Arguments\\n\\n- **`callback`**: Required function which will run.\\n\\n##### useMount Usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\nimport { useMount } from '@availity/hooks';\\n// ...\\nconst Component = () => {\\n  useMount(() => {\\n    doSomethingOnMount();\\n\\n    return () => {\\n      doSomethingOnDismount();\\n    };\\n  });\\n\\n  return <div>Test Component</div>;\\n};\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n\\n#### useCurrentRegion\\n\\nHook that will return the current user's region.\\n\\n\\n##### useCurrentRegion Usage\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\nimport { useCurrentRegion } from '@availity/hooks';\\n// ...\\nconst Component = () => {\\n  const [region,loading] = useCurrentRegion();\\n\\n  return <div>Test Component</div>;\\n};\\n//

This is because the underlying react-select does not return the event in it's callbacks.\\n\\n### AvSelect (Default export)\\n\\nThis is the underlying select without the `AvGroup`, `Label` or `AvFeedback`\\n\\n#### AvSelect Props\\n\\nPlease refer to [react-select with async pagination](https://github.com/TheSharpieOne/react-select/tree/npm/v2-async-pagination)'s props and [availity-reactstrap-validation](https://github.com/Availity/availity-reactstrap-validation)'s input validation props. This component just combines those.\\n\\n*   **`raw`**: Boolean. Optional. Default: `false`. If `true`, the entire object of the selected value will be returned as the value instead of the value for the `valueKey` within the object.\\n*   **`valueKey`**: String. Optional. The key of the value you want returned when selected. Default: `value`\\n*   **`labelKey`**: String. Optional. The key for the label you want to appear in the dropdown for the user to see.

In order for a field to be auto-filled, the `name` property on the field _must_ match the key inside the new value. For example, if the new value is `{ \\\"payer\\\": \\\"Availity\\\" }`, in order for the payer input in the form to be auto-filled to \\\"Availity\\\", the `name` prop on the input must be \\\"payer\\\". If `autofill` is an object, when the value of the dropdown changes, if the `isMulti` prop is `false` _and_ the new value of the dropdown is an object, all fields on the form corresponding to the keys in the `autofill` prop will be auto-filled. For example, if the new value is `{ \\\"payer\\\": { \\\"name\\\": \\\"Availity\\\", \\\"id\\\": \\\"1\\\" } }`, in order for the \\\"payerName\\\" and \\\"payerId\\\" inputs to be auto-filled to \\\"Availity\\\" and \\\"1\\\" respectively, the `autofill` prop should be `{ payerName: 'payer.name', payerId: 'payer.id' }`.\\n\\n#### AvSelect Example usage\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { Label } from 'reactstrap';\\nimport { AvForm, AvGroup, AvFeedback } from 'availity-reactstrap-validation';\\nimport AvSelect from '@availity/reactstrap-validation-select';\\nimport '@availity/reactstrap-validation-select/styles.scss';\\n// ...\\nconst options = [\\n    {label: \\\"Option 1\\\", value: 1},\\n    {label: \\\"Option 2\\\", value: 2},\\n    {label: \\\"Option 3\\\", value: 3},\\n];\\n// ...\\n<AvForm>\\n    <AvGroup>\\n        <Label for=\\\"justTheInput\\\">My Input Label</Label>\\n        <AvSelect\\n            name=\\\"justTheInput\\\"\\n            options={options}\\n            required\\n        />\\n        <AvFeedback>Some error message</AvFeedback>\\n    </AvGroup>\\n</AvForm>;\\n```\\n\\n### AvSelectField\\n\\nPlease refer to [react-select with async pagination](https://github.com/TheSharpieOne/react-select/tree/npm/v2-async-pagination)'s props and [availity-reactstrap-validation](https://github.com/Availity/availity-reactstrap-validation)'s field validation props.

If provided, the rendered component will mimic `AvSelectField` instead of `AvSelect` (it will create a group with a label and feedback).\\n*   **`requestConfig`**: Object. Optional. Configuration object which will be used with the query method on the resource. Useful for defining headers to be sent with the request.\\n*   **`parameters`**: Object. Optional. Object which will be used to create querystring parameters in the request.\\n*   **`customerId`**: String. Optional. The value of the customer ID which will be sent in the parameters. Useful for restricting the loaded options to be related to the organization the user has in context.\\n*   **`requiredParams`**: Array of strings. Optional. If present, the network request will not be made until all of the required parameters specified in the array have a truthy value.\\n*   **`cacheUniq`**: Any. Optional. When this prop changes, all cache options are cleared. (see [react-select-async-paginate](https://github.com/vtaits/react-select-async-paginate#cacheuniq))\\n*   **`watchParams`**: Array of strings. Optional. If present, the options will reset when any of the parameters specified in the array change value. This is useful for when a customerId changes and you need to load a new list of options for the user to choose from. Used to derive `cacheUniq` if `cacheUniq` prop is not provided.\\n*   **`resource`**: Availity API resource (see [@availity/api-core](https://github.com/Availity/sdk-js/tree/master/packages/api-core) and [@availity/api-axios](https://github.com/Availity/sdk-js/tree/master/packages/api-axios)). Required.\\n*   **`getResult`**: String or Function. Optional. When a function, the function will be called with the API response body/payload and is expected to return an array containing the list of items for the page. When a string, the string is expected to be a simple key used to get the value from the response (\\\"simple\\\" meaning not handling dot-notation for nested objects, if you need that provide a function.)\\n*   **`debounceTimeout`**: Number. default: 350. The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the user has stopped typing before making the network request (debounced input).\\n*   **`delay`**: Number. default: 350. Set to `debounceTimeout` if `debounceTimeout` is not provided. (see [react-select-async-paginate](https://github.com/vtaits/react-select-async-paginate#debouncetimeout))\\n*   **`itemsPerPage`**: Number. Optional. Default: `50`. The number of items to fetched be displayed per page when the usr scrolls down.\\n*   **`onPageChange`**: Function. Optional. A callback function to inform you that the user has scrolled to the bottom of the list and more items are loaded. The current input value and the page the user wants to go to will be provided as arguments to the callback function.\\n*   **`hasMore`**: Boolean or Function. Optional. If true, `AvResourceSelect` will attempt to retrieve the next page of results. `response.data` from axios response is passed as the only argument to `hasMore` when `hasMore` is a function. Defaults to: `({ totalCount, limit, offset }) => totalCount > offset + limit;` for non-GraphQL apis. Defaults to `(data) => data.data[${this.props.graphqlConfig.type}Pagination].pageInfo.hasNextPage` for GraphQL apis.\\n*   **`additional`**: Object. Optional. Additional properties to pass to `AsyncPaginate` (see [react-select-async-paginate](https://github.com/vtaits/react-select-async-paginate#additional)).\\n*   **`graphqlConfig`**: Object{ type, query }.

Whether or not to allow new items to be created if not found.\\n*   **`autofill`**: Boolean or Object. Optional. Default: `false`. If `true`, when the value of the dropdown changes, if the `isMulti` prop is `false` _and_ the new value of the dropdown is an object, all fields on the form corresponding to the new value will be auto-filled. In order for a field to be auto-filled, the `name` property on the field _must_ match the key inside the new value. For example, if the new value is `{ \\\"payer\\\": \\\"Availity\\\" }`, in order for the payer input in the form to be auto-filled to \\\"Availity\\\", the `name` prop on the input must be \\\"payer\\\".
